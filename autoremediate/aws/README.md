# Auto-Remediation via Lambda

A core design goal and philosophy at **Evident.io** is to provide our customers the most robust configuration security alerting platform on AWS and the remediation guidance to make those alerts actionable. Using our SNS integration, customers can extend that philosophy to make sure alerts are automatically remediated before you, or malicious actors, even know thereâ€™s an issue.

## How it Works...

![Auto-Remediation Flow](../../autoremediate/images/remediate-flow.jpg)

1. An ESP Signature via Amazon SNS integration triggers an alert and send it to Lambda.
2. The Lambda auto-remediation function is launched and performs the following:
    a. Checks the ESP Signature status; Pass/Fail?
    b. If Fail; run checks to verify and remediate, log and exit.
3. In some cases it may make sense to bypass the checks and remediate immediately.  This accomplishes two things: 1) Faster Lambda function execution, and 2) Performs fewer AWS API calls.
