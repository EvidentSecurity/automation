# Auto-Remediation via Lambda

A core design goal and philosophy at **Evident.io** is to provide our customers the most robust configuration security alerting platform on AWS and the remediation guidance to make those alerts actionable. Using our SNS integration, customers can extend that philosophy to make sure alerts are automatically remediated before you, or malicious actors, even know thereâ€™s an issue.

For more information, please see [Evident Docs](http://docs.evident.io/#auto-remediation-via-lambda-walkthrough)
